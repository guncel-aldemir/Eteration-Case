## üß± Architecture & Patterns

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for clean separation
- **Coordinator Pattern** for navigation flow
- **UseCase & Repository Pattern** to separate business logic
- **Dependency Injection** via `AppFactory` and `ScreenFactory`
- **NotificationCenter** for state sync across views
- **Core Data** for local persistence (favorites, cart)

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

Unit tests are written for all critical view models:

- ‚úÖ `HomeViewModelTests`
- ‚úÖ `DetailViewModelTests`
- ‚úÖ `CartViewModelTests`

Test cases are built using:
- Mock repositories
- Dummy use case implementations
- XCTExpectations for async flows

## üõ† Technologies

- Swift (iOS 15+)
- UIKit with Auto Layout (no Storyboards)
- Core Data
- XCTest
- MVVM + Coordinator
- NotificationCenter
- Modular architecture

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works

### Product Listing
Fetched from mock or real APIs using `NetworkManager`, supports infinite scrolling.

### Product Details
Displays product info with ability to add to cart.

### Favorites
Products can be favorited/unfavorited and persisted in Core Data.

### Cart
Items are added/removed from Core Data. TabBar shows live badge updates.

### Filtering
Users can filter products by brand or model via multiple selection UI.
